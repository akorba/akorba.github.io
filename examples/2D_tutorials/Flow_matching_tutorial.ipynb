        "As explained earlier,  the computation of the unconditional vector field $u_t(x)$ and probability path $p_t(x)$ are intractable. Nevertheless, we can easily sample from the conditional probability path $p_t(x|z)$, given its Gaussian nature, and compute the conditional vector field $u_t(x|z)$ with the available closed-form expression.  Consequently, instead of regressing against the unconditional vector field, we opt to regress our network $v_\\theta$ against the $\\textit{conditional vector field}$ $u_t(x|z)$. The Conditional Flow Matching loss is thus defined as:\n",

Thus, we want to leverage this property in order to produce straighter flows that would lead to a faster inference process.\n",

To move $\\alpha$ towards $\\beta$, the task is to transport each individual sample mass $\\frac1n$ from $\\alpha$ to $\\beta$ samples.\n",

It means that each sample's mass $\\frac1n$ has been moved to the other distribution. These constraints guarantee the conservation of mass during the transport process.\n",

That is why we evaluate the distance between the supports of the source and target distributions (*i.e.*, $(x_i)_{i=1}^n$ for $\\alpha$ and $(z_j)_{j=1}^n$ for $\\beta$). This involves introducing a ground cost matrix $C$, where $C_{ij} = \\|x_i - z_j\\|$ measures the distance between the support points $x_i$ and $z_j$.\n",
