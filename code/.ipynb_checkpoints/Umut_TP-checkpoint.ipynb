    "The goal of this practical session is to implement the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD -- Welling & Teh, ICML 2011) algorithm in order to draw samples from the posterior distribution of a Gaussian probabilistic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this task might seem \"synthetic\" at a first glance, it has an important role in scientific studies: We will design the probabilistic model in a way that the posterior distribution can be computed analytically. This approach will enable us to measure the performance of our algorithm, since the answer that we would like to find in the beginning is already known; hence, we can compare our results to the \"ground truth\". This is very standard practice in academic studies.\n",
